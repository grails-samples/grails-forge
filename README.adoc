This project represents a web based Grails project creator. Grails projects may be created using the browser interface or via curl.

With curl you can query the following APIs to learn which versions, profiles, and features are available

    /versions
    /$version/profiles
    /$version/$profile/features

Example:

    curl http://localhost:8080/versions
    curl http://localhost:8080/3.2.1/profiles
    curl http://localhost:8080/3.2.1/angular2/features

You can also generate an application with curl. The following example will use the latest release with default parameters.

    curl -O http://localhost:8080/myApp.zip

You can also specify the version, profile, and features

    curl -O http://localhost:8080/myApp.zip -d version=3.2.2 -d profile=angular2 -d features=hibernate4,mongo

== Project Testing
